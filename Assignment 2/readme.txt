Instructions:

Created my portfolio website which contains 4 sections -> Home, Projects, Skills and Contact.

Points covered in the application:
Use an external CSS file
Use of float/overflow property
Use of column layout structure
use of absolute/relative position whenever necessary.
use of tel, mailto option for contact information 
use of css selectors
use of image gallery for skill section
Use of html and  html5 elements throughout. 
Website is completely responsive. (Supports all device widths)

Note:
1. Website not only supports these device widths like IPad(768px) and Smartphones (350 â€“ 365px) but also supports all other device dimensions.
2. Multiple UI manipulations for device-specific dimensions.
3. Page-level CSS files are provided instead of maintaining a single external file.
4. Used ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) tags wherever necessary to make the application accessible to users with disabilities who use assistive technologies (AT).
5. UI rich.
