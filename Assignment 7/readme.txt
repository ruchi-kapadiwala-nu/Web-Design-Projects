Technologies Used:
• HTML
• CSS
• SASS/SCSS

CSS Grid Layout:
• I used CSS Grid Layout to create a responsive layout for my website.
• The grid is divided into three columns, with the first column being narrower than the other two.
• This column is used to display the website's navigation menu.
• The other two columns are used to display the website's content.
• The grid is responsive, meaning that it will adapt to different screen sizes.

Flexbox:
• I used Flexbox to create a flexible and responsive navigation menu.
• The menu items are displayed horizontally and adjust their size and position based on the available space.
• When the screen size is small, the menu items are displayed vertically, and the menu becomes a hamburger menu.

SASS/SCSS Features: I used several SASS/SCSS features to make my code more organized and easier to maintain.
• Variables: 
  Used to store common values such as colors, fonts, and sizes, making it easier to update these values in the future.
• Custom Properties: 
  Used to store values that are specific to certain elements. For instance, I used custom properties to store the background color of the navigation menu.
• Nesting: 
  I employed nesting to organize the CSS code and enhance its readability. For instance, I nested the styles for the navigation menu under a nav selector.
• Interpolation: 
  I used interpolation to generate dynamic class names. For instance, I used interpolation to generate class names for the different sections of the website.
• Placeholder Selectors: 
  I used placeholder selectors to define reusable styles that can be included in other selectors. For example, I defined a placeholder selector for the hover effect on links.
• Mixins: 
  I used mixins to define reusable sets of styles. For example, I defined a mixin for the box-shadow property.
• Functions: 
  I employed functions to perform calculations and generate dynamic values. For instance, I used a function to calculate the width of the columns in the CSS Grid layout.
